  # - `translation_attributes`: seed all translations at creation. `[{ locale: :de, question: "...", choices: "..." }]`
  # - `type`: STI-name of question type
  # - `event_type`: STI-name of Event, on which the global question should be applied. `nil` will apply to all events.
  # - `disclosure`: specifies if question is required, optional or hidden. `nil` will force choice at event creation.
