module AbilityDsl
  # Base class for defining abilities.
  # Abilities are defined for models, usually only for one per ability class.
  # Eg.
  #  on(Person) do
  #    class_side(:index).everybody
  #
  #    permission(:group_read).may(:show).in_same_group
  #    permission(:layer_and_below_full).may(:update, :destroy).in_same_layer_or_below
  #  end
  #
  # All permissions in the given block apply for a Person instance.
  # Each permission then is defined for one Role::Permission, several actions and
  # one arbitrary constraint.
  # This constraint must exist as an instance method in the same class and return
  # true if the current Person instance applies. The constraint method should have
  # a speaking name that describes its complete purpose.
  #
  # With a +general+ constraint an additional requirement for certain actions
  # may be defined, indifferent of the user's permissions.
  #
  # To define abilities for class side actions (if no subject instance is passed to +can?+),
  # the +class_side+ method with the corresponding actions has to be used.
  # The following constraint methods must also be defined as instance methods, but there
  # will be no subject and no permission instance variables available. Therefore,
  # certain helper methods like +permission_in_group?+ or permission_in_layers?+ must not
  # be used.
  #
  # Every permission tuple (Role::Permission, Action), including :general,
  # only has one corresponding constraint method. This may be overriden by wagons.
  #
  # BEWARE: The constraint methods only apply if you pass an instance to the #can?
  # method. If you pass a class, no constraints will be checked at all!
