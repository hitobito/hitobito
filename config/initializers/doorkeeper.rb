  # Reuse access token for the same resource owner within an application (disabled by default).

  # This option protects your application from creating new tokens before old valid one becomes
  # expired so your database doesn't bloat. Keep in mind that when this option is `on` Doorkeeper
  # doesn't updates existing token expiration time, it will create a new token instead.
  # Rationale: https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper/issues/383

  # Issue access tokens with refresh token (disabled by default), you may also
  # pass a block which accepts `context` to customize when to give a refresh
  # token or not. Similar to `custom_access_token_expires_in`, `context` has
  # the properties:
  #
  # `client` - the OAuth client application (see Doorkeeper::OAuth::Client)
  # `grant_type` - the grant type of the request (see Doorkeeper::OAuth)
  # `scopes` - the requested scopes (see Doorkeeper::OAuth::Scopes)

  # Provide support for an owner to be assigned to each registered application (disabled by default)
  # Optional parameter confirmation: true (default false) if you want to enforce ownership of

  # Change the native redirect uri for client apps
  # When clients register with the following redirect uri, they won't be redirected to any server and
  # the authorizationcode will be displayed within the provider
  # The value can be any string. Use nil to disable this feature. When disabled, clients must provide a valid URL
  # (Similar behaviour: https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2InstalledApp#choosingredirecturi)
  #
  # native_redirect_uri 'urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob'

  # Forces the usage of the HTTPS protocol in non-native redirect uris (enabled
  # by default in non-development environments). OAuth2 delegates security in
  # communication to the HTTPS protocol so it is wise to keep this enabled.
  #
  # Callable objects such as proc, lambda, block or any object that responds to
  # #call can be used in order to allow conditional checks (to allow non-SSL
  # redirects to localhost for example).

  # Specify what redirect URI's you want to block during Application creation.
  # Any redirect URI is whitelisted by default.

  # You can use this option in order to forbid URI's with 'javascript' scheme
  # for example.

  # forbid_redirect_uri { |uri| uri.scheme.to_s.downcase == 'javascript' }

  # Specify how authorization errors should be handled.
  # By default, doorkeeper renders json errors when access token
  # is invalid, expired, revoked or has invalid scopes.
  #
  # If you want to render error response yourself (i.e. rescue exceptions),
  # set  handle_auth_errors to `:raise` and rescue Doorkeeper::Errors::InvalidToken
  # or following specific errors:
  #
  #   Doorkeeper::Errors::TokenForbidden, Doorkeeper::Errors::TokenExpired,
  #   Doorkeeper::Errors::TokenRevoked, Doorkeeper::Errors::TokenUnknown
  #
  # handle_auth_errors :raise

  # Specify what grant flows are enabled in array of Strings. The valid
  # strings and the flows they enable are:
  #
  # "authorization_code" => Authorization Code Grant Flow
  # "implicit"           => Implicit Grant Flow
  # "password"           => Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant Flow
  # "client_credentials" => Client Credentials Grant Flow
  #
  # If not specified, Doorkeeper enables authorization_code and
  # client_credentials.
  #
  # implicit and password grant flows have risks that you should understand
  # before enabling:
  #   http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-4.4.2

  # end
  #
  # after_successful_strategy_response do |request, response|
  #   puts "AFTER HOOK FIRED! #{request}, #{response}"
  # end

  # Hook into Authorization flow in order to implement Single Sign Out
  # or add ny other functionality.

  # so that the user skips the authorization step.
